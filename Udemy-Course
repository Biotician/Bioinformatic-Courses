Chain Termination Method, Sanger Sequencing, First Generation Sequencing
Cost per genome over the years
Next Generation Sequencing, Massively Parallel Sequencing
Not good at reading long sequences, but many short strecthes.
Takes long genome and sequences fragments randomly thoughout the gene.
150 - couple hundred nucleotides long.

Base Quality.

Phred33:
Round Q off to nearest integer, add 33 to it, and then convert it to corresponding character.



Sequencing Errors and Base Qualities.
Unterminated base allows another base to be incorporated on top of the base. This makes
one of the template strands out of sync. This continues to occur with more strands as the
sequencing cycle continues.

One software analyzses these images and tries to deal with this ambiguity - called a Base Caller.
If the base caller is not confident, we need to know this - which bases may not be true.
Base Quality is the Base Callers estimate that the base was called incorrectly.
Q = -10 * log10(p), where Q is the base quality and p is the probability that base call is incorrect.
Q = 10 -> 1 in 10 chance call is incorrect
Q = 20 -> 1 in 100
Q = 30 -> 1 in 1,000.

Call: Orange(C)
Estimate p, probability incorrect:
    non-orange light / total light
p = 3 green / 9 total = 1/3
Q = -10 * log10(1/3)
Each base quality, Q, is an ASCII-encoded version of Q=-10log10p

The character I (capital i) has ASCII value 73.  Assuming Phred+33 encoding, what is the corresponding base quality?
